command: ps

ps stands for process status, and will print a list of processes that are currently running.

using ps x will give a list of all processes running on your computer.

grep can be used in tandem with ps to search for specific types of processes running on the system.

eg. ps x | grep bash
would give a list of all bash processes currently running on the system.
