command: wc 

wc can be used to count and print the number of lines, words, characters and bytes in a specified file.
if used alone, wc will return the line, word and byte counts.

eg. wc sample.txt

would return something like: 4 20 32 sample.txt
4 is the number of lines
20 is the number of words
32 is the numbers of bytes

wc -c will return bytes count only
wc -m will return character count only
wc -l will return line count only
wc -w will return the word count only
