command: cp

The cp command is used to copy files and directories. 
eg. cp hello.txt helloagain.txt
would copy the contents of the file 'hello.txt' to a new file 'helloagain.txt'

You can also copy entire directory structures by copying recursively 
eg. cp -R ~/Projects/Files ~/Backup/Projects/Files
