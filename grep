The grep command can be used to search text or search a specified file for lines that contain a specified letter, word etc.
Grep then displays the matching lines. 
eg. grep "A" ~/sometext.txt
would search the file 'sometext.txt' for lines containing a capital 'A'

Grep can also be used in conjunction with pipes in order to search directories 
eg. ls | grep ^T
would list the contents of the current directory and pass the output to grep.
Grep would then search that list for lines beginning with a capital T and return those in the shell.
